This package consists of a collection of tools to study the dynamic aperture of a particle accelerator built with [Xsuite](https://github.com/xsuite/xsuite). In a sense, it is a replacement of the [DA study template](https://github.com/xsuite/DA_study_template), but much more advanced. It also allows to configure colliders and do tracking without necessarily running parametric scans.

The whole project is described in details in the [full documentation](https://colasdroin.github.io/study-DA/), along with tutorials and description of the implemented functions.

## Installation

The package is available on PyPI and can be installed using `pip`.

```bash
pip install study-da
```

Proper installation might require additional instructions. Please refer to the [full documentation](https://colasdroin.github.io/study-DA/) for more details.
